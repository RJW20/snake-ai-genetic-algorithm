# Snake Ai: Genetic Algorithm
Application of the Genetic Algorithm to the game Snake.

## Basic Requirements
1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for ease of installing the dependencies.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the repo `git clone https://github.com/RJW20/snake_ai_genetic_algorithm.git`.
2. Download the submodules `git submodule update --init`.
3. Set up the virtual environment `poetry install`.
4. Enter the virtual environment `poetry shell`.

## Running the Algorithm
1. Change any settings you want in `snake_ai/settings.py`. For more information on what they control see [here](https://github.com/RJW20/genetic_algorithm_template/blob/main/README.md) and [here](https://github.com/RJW20/snake_app/blob/main/README.md)
2. Run the algorithm `poetry run main`.
3. View the playback of saved history with `poetry run playback`.
